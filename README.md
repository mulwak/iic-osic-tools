# IIC-OSIC-TOOLS Remote X Remix

This environment is a fork from [IIC-OSIC-TOOLS](https://github.com/iic-jku/iic-osic-tools), which is based on the [efabless.com FOSS-ASIC-TOOLS](https://github.com/efabless/foss-asic-tools).

This allows **multiple users** connected to the server machine via SSH to use the CAD tools through **X11 forwarding**.

See my [blog post](http://ponzu840w.starfree.jp/blog/blog.html?id=00051) for details. It is written in Japanese, but you can use the conveniences of civilization (mainly provided by Google etc.)!
